The 2019 FIFA Club World Cup (officially known as the FIFA Club World Cup Qatar 2019 presented by Alibaba Cloud for sponsorship reasons)[1] was the 16th edition of the FIFA Club World Cup, a FIFA-organised international club football tournament between the winners of the six continental confederations, as well as the host nation's league champions. The tournament was hosted by Qatar between 11 and 21 December 2019, taking place at two venues in Doha.[2]

Real Madrid were the three-time defending champions, but could not defend their title after being eliminated in the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League round of 16.

			President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi congratulated Ahly senior football team on Friday for claiming the bronze medal of the FIFA Club World Cup as well as breaking records while participating in the prestigious tournament.

			The Cairo giants claimed the FIFA Club World Cup's bronze medal for a second time after beating South American champions Palmeiras 3-2 on penalties following a goal-less draw at Qatar's Al-Rayyan on Thursday.

			"I congratulate Ahly football team for winning third place in the FIFA Club World Cup and [for their] honourable performance,” El-Sisi said in a tweet.

			"I also affirm the country's pride and continuous support of all honourable Egyptian sports models and all sports activities in Egypt, hoping for continued success for all Egyptian sports activities," the president added.

			Ahly started their mission in the prestigious tournament on 4 February by beating hosts Qatari side Al-Duhail 1-0 before suffering a narrow 2-0 loss to the World Champions Bayern Munich, that set up a third-place decider game against Palmeiras.

			The record nine-time African champions, Ahly broke more records after claiming the bronze medal as it is the first time for the Red devils to overcome the Copa Libertadores winners. They are the African team that has achieved the most victories in the FIFA Club World Cup with five victories in total.

        <h2>We made history for ourselves, says Ahly keeper El-Shennawi</h2>
        <p>

			Ahly keeper Mohamed El-Shennawi was over the moon after his team clinched the bronze medal at the Club World Cup with a shootout win over Palmeiras, saying the current crop have made history for themselves.
			The African champions beat Brazil's Palmeiras 3-2 on penalties following a goalless draw, with El-Shennawi playing an instrumental role in the famous win with two saves in the shootout.

			"I am very happy after we won the third place," El-Shennawi told beIN Sports after the game.

			"We made a great history for us. We were determined to realize an achievement in the competition and we did a great job that corresponds with the big name of our club.

			"I would have said the same words even if we had lost, because we exerted great effort."

			The 32-year-old keeper was typically humble, crediting his teammates for the win rather than his own shootout heroics.

			"I thank all the players for their efforts during the game. They did a great job and all the team played well, not only me," he added.

			"Before the game, we analyzed Palmeiras' playing style and we also knew how they normally take their penalties. It wasn't random."
